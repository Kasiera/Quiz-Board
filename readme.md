# Description

This application is a simple test consisting of ten questions about JavaScript. It is expected that the user should respond to all the ten questions by checking the relevant radio-heads in the multiple choice section then submit it their feedback. The outcome is then calculated and pops up on the screen as feedback for the user.

# BDD

The program checks if all the questions have been answered

The program also ensures that the user cannot select more than one option
Example input: No checked radio-heads
Example output: 0

Example input: option one checked
Example output: result (If correct, the user is awarded 10 marks, if wrong, the user is awarded 0)
